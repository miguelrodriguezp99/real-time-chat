This project is designed to showcase the capabilities of WebSocket technology for real-time communication, integrated with a robust backend and frontend framework to ensure a secure and efficient user experience.

## Technologies Used

- **React:** Used for building a dynamic and responsive user interface, facilitating an engaging user experience.
- **MongoDB:** Acts as the database to store user data and chat messages, ensuring quick data retrieval for a real-time experience.
- **Socket.io:** Enables real-time, bidirectional and event-based communication between web clients and servers, making the core feature of instant messaging possible.
- **HTML & CSS:** The foundation for structuring and styling the application's content.
- **Tailwind CSS:** Utilized for rapid UI development, providing a sleek, modern look with responsive design.
- **Node.js:** The runtime environment for running JavaScript on the server-side, forming the backbone of our backend logic.
- **Express:** A web application framework for Node.js, used to build our server-side APIs, handling requests and responses smoothly.
- **JWT & Cookies:** For secure authentication and authorization. JWT tokens are stored in cookies to manage user sessions securely and efficiently.

## Features
